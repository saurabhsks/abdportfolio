          <ul>
            <li>
              <p><strong>1984</strong>-Abraham Benjamin de Villiers (born 17 February 1984) is a former South African professional cricketer. De Villiers was named as the ICC ODI Player of the Year three times during his 15-year international career and was one of the five Wisden cricketers of the decade at the end of 2019.[2]</p>
            </li>
            <li><p><strong>2004 Early Carrier</strong>-He made his Test debut as a 20-year-old on 16 December 2004 against England at Port Elizabeth. He made a strong impression opening the batting, but was dropped down the order for the second Test and also handed the wicket-keeping gloves. In this match, he made a match-saving half-century from number seven. However, he found himself at the top of the order again for the final Test of the series.</p></li>
            <li><p><strong>2006</strong>-De Villiers had a reputation as an outstanding fielder, typified by a diving run-out of Simon Katich of Australia in 2006, when he dived to stop the ball, and while still lying on his stomach facing away from the stumps, he tossed the ball backwards over his shoulder and effected a direct hit</p></li>
            
            <li><p><strong>2007 World Cup</strong>-Competing in the 2007 Cricket World Cup, AB was in very good form in ODIs, having scored four 50s during the South Africa vs India/Pakistan (2007).</P></li>
          <li><p><strong>2011 World Cup</strong>-AB de Villiers scored two successive centuries in the 2011 World Cup. He became the first South African to score two centuries in a single World Cup and the fifth batsman after Mark Waugh, Saeed Anwar, Rahul Dravid and Matthew Hayden to score two consecutive centuries in a single World Cup tournament.</p></li>
           <li><p><strong>2015</strong>-On 18 January 2015, De Villiers scored both the fastest fifty and the fastest century by a batsman in One Day International cricket, off 16 balls and 31 balls respectively and eventually scoring 149 runs off 44 balls in 59.5 minutes[33] against West Indies.[34]</p></li>
          <li><p><strong>2018 & Retirement</strong>-23 May 2018, De Villiers announced his retirement from all forms of international cricket through a video uploaded to Twitter, in which he explained his decision.[47][48] One of the statements in his monologue was "I have had my turn, and to be honest, I am tired."[49] A few weeks after his announcement about retiring from international cricket, he clarified and said that he will continue playing T20 leagues for a few more years</p></li>
           <li><p><strong>2011-2021 IPL</strong>-Since joining the league in its inaugural season, de Villiers has become one of the most successful batsmen in the Indian Premier League (IPL). After originally playing for Delhi Daredevils, he moved to Royal Challengers Bangalore (RCB) for US$1.5 million in the league's fourth season. Three of his four Twenty20 centuries have come in the IPL and he has played in over 150 matches in the league.</p></li>
           <li><p><strong>Playing Style</strong>-He is sometimes referred to as "Mr. 360" due to his ability to play shots all around the wicket,[62] and as "Superman" due to his acrobatic fielding.[63] In T20 cricket he is seen as an attacking batsman who plays a range of unconventional shots.[64]</p></li>
          <li><p><strong>Personal Life</strong>-De Villiers proposed to his girlfriend, Danielle Swart, at the Taj Mahal in 2012, after five years of dating.[65] The couple got married on 30 March 2013, in Bela-Bela, South Africa. They have two sons and one daughter.[66][67][68]
<br>
He is a devout Christian and has stated that his faith is crucial to his approach to life.[69] He is also an accomplished guitar player and a singer. In 2010, he released a bilingual pop album entitled Maak Jou Drome Waar with his friend and South African singer Ampie du Preez.[70] His autobiography, was released in September, 2016.[71]</p></li>
